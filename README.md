# Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Regression Project
This project involves implementing a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for a regression task using a custom neural network implementation. The training process is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE).

## Project Details

The notebook performs the following steps:

1. **Data Initialization**: Initializes the input data and model parameters.
2. **Model Definition**: Defines the MLP model architecture and the optimizer.
3. **Training Loop**: Trains the MLP model for a specified number of epochs, calculates the loss using Mean Squared Error (MSE), and updates the model parameters using backpropagation.
4. **Evaluation**: Prints the loss and model predictions at each epoch.

## Results

The training process prints the loss and model predictions at each epoch, allowing you to observe the model's learning progress.


## Project Structure
