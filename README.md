# Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Regression Project
This project involves implementing a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for a regression task using a custom neural network implementation. The training process is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE).
## Project Details
The notebook performs the following steps:

- Data Initialization: Initializes the input data and model parameters.
- Model Definition: Defines the MLP model architecture and the optimizer.
- Training Loop: Trains the MLP model for a specified number of epochs, calculates the loss using Mean Squared Error (MSE), and updates the model parameters using backpropagation.
- Evaluation: Prints the loss and model predictions at each epoch.
- The training process prints the loss and model predictions at each epoch, allowing you to observe the model's learning progress.\
